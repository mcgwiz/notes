Hi. I'm Mike McGranahan (he/him) a husband, father, and <a href="https://mcgwiz.com">software professional</a>. Coffee, Mexican food, and alt pop keep me sane. I've got a lot of thoughts about developer-friendly software, engineering management, parenting and family life, personal technology and safety, health, the environment, and equal rights. Occasionally I find the time to make a note of them. Reach me at mike@mcgwiz.com. Thanks for stopping by.
