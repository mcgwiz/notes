My name is Mike McGranahan (he/him). I'm a husband and father, and I <a href="https://mcgwiz.com">work in software</a>. Coffee, Mexican food, and alt-pop music keep me sane.

I've got many ideas about developer experience, engineering management, home and personal technology, parenting and family life, health, the environment, and equal rights. Occasionally I make a note of them.

Feel free to reach me at mike@mcgwiz.com.
