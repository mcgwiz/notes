* C# evolves [quickly](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-version-history)
  * Functional-style pattern matching was introduced in version 7
  * The feature has expanded with every version since then
  * I needed something to help me learn them, so I could design my code around them rather than let my IDE patch up my code with them
* I've been experimenting with ChatGPT
  * I asked it to create a table having each pattern form, along with variants, descriptions, and examples
  * I used the ChatGPT clipboard button to retrieve the output as Markdown
  * I used the [Markdown PDF](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf) VS Code extension to transform it into a PDF
  * I saved this to my phone and synced storage, and printed a hardcopy, to study conveniently
  * ChatGPT has outdated information; I had to add a couple missing patterns
  * I want to try this technique again the next time I need a learning aid
* Here's the [result](/assets/attachments/csharp-patterns-cheatsheet.pdf)
