* c# evolves [quickly](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-version-history)
  * functional-style pattern matching was introduced in version 7
  * feature has expanded with every version since then
  * wanted to learn them better so I could design my code around them rather than let my IDE patch up my code with them
* been experimenting with ChatGPT
  * asked it to create a table having each pattern form, along with variants, descriptions, and examples
  * used the ChatGPT clipboard button to retrieve the output as Markdown
  * used the [Markdown PDF](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf) VS Code extension to transform it into a PDF
  * convenient for study
    * saved to my phone and [synced](https://syncthing.net/) storage
    * printed a hardcopy
  * ChatGPT has outdated information
    * had to add a couple missing patterns
  * want to try this technique again the next time I need a learning aid
* here's the [result](/assets/attachments/csharp-patterns-cheatsheet.pdf)
