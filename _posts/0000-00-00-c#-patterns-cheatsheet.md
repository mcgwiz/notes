C# evolves [fairly often](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-version-history). Many changes enhance existing features, and some fundamentally reshape the language. Functional-style pattern matching falls somewhere in between. They were introduced in C# 7 and were extended in every release since. Now they comprise a powerful tool in the C# developer's belt, but many developers (me) don't seem too familiar with them (beyond the automated refactorings their IDE suggests).

So to experiment with ChatGPT, I asked it to create a Markdown table of C# pattern matching features, along with variants, descriptions and examples. I used the [Markdown PDF](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf) VS Code extension to transform it into HTML, and then saved the output as a PDF. This can be saved to one's desktop or phone for study while waiting in line, or be directly turned into a hardcopy. Overall the process was relatively quick and painless, and I'm interested in trying this technique again in the future when needing a learning aid.

Here's the [result](/assets/attachments/csharp-patterns-cheatsheet.pdf).
