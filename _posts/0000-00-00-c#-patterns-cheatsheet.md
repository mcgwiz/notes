* C# evolves [quickly](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-version-history)
  * Functional-style pattern matching was introduced in version 7
  * Feature has expanded with every version since then
  * Wanted to learn them better so I could design my code around them rather than let my IDE patch up my code with them
* Been experimenting with ChatGPT
  * Asked it to create a table having each pattern form, along with variants, descriptions, and examples
  * Used the ChatGPT clipboard button to retrieve the output as Markdown
  * Used the [Markdown PDF](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf) VS Code extension to transform it into a PDF
  * Convenient for study
    * Saved to my phone and [synced](https://syncthing.net/) storage
    * Printed a hardcopy
  * ChatGPT has outdated information
    * Had to add a couple missing patterns
  * Want to try this technique again the next time I need a learning aid
* Here's the [result](/assets/attachments/csharp-patterns-cheatsheet.pdf)
