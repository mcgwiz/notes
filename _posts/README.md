Using 0000-00-00 for date in the filename, because I want to use :slug (based on filename title) for permalink. This forces the filenames to be unique, so the slugs will be unique - otherwise when using :slug and two filenames differ only in date, one of the posts will not be served. The flipside is that the date needs to be specified in the frontmatter.
